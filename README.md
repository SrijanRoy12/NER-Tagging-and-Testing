# NER-Tagging-and-Testing
A Named Entity Recognition (NER) Tagging Tool built for efficient annotation, correction, and retraining of NER models.
This tool helps streamline the process of identifying and labeling entities in text datasets, making it ideal for data scientists, NLP engineers, and annotation teams.

📌 Features
NER Model Integration – Uses a pre-trained or fine-tuned NER model (e.g., BERT, spaCy, or custom models).
Interactive Annotation Interface – Tag entities directly through an easy-to-use UI.
Model Predictions + Manual Edits – Start with automatic predictions and refine them manually.
Dataset Management – Load text datasets for annotation and store results in structured JSON.
Retraining Support – Corrected datasets can be exported for retraining models.
Multiple File Format Support – Supports .txt, .json, and dataset directory imports.
CUDA/CPU Support – Runs on both CPU and GPU for faster processing.

⚙️ Installation

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NER-Tagging-Tool.git
cd NER-Tagging-Tool


2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows


3️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


4️⃣ Download/Place Your Model

Place your fine-tuned model in the NERmodel/ directory.

The tool supports HuggingFace Transformer-based models.

🚀 Usage

Run the Streamlit App

streamlit run app.py


Command-Line Mode (optional if implemented)

python app.py --input TEXT_DATASETS/ --output corrected_json/

📊 Workflow

Load Dataset – Select a dataset file or folder from TEXT_DATASETS/.

Run Model Prediction – The model suggests entity tags.

Manual Correction – Fix incorrect tags via the UI.

Save Corrected Annotations – Export corrected results to corrected_json/.

Prepare Retraining Data – Export final dataset to retrain_dataset/ for model improvement.

🧠 Model & Training

Default: Pre-trained BERT model for token classification.

You can fine-tune on your domain-specific data using corrected datasets.

Supports transfer learning for faster convergence.

📦 Output Format

Corrected annotations are saved in JSON format:

[
  {
    "text": "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs.",
    "entities": [
      {"entity": "ORG", "start": 0, "end": 10},
      {"entity": "PERSON", "start": 27, "end": 37}
    ]
  }
]
